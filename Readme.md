## Abstract

This research proposes utilizing integrated waveguide-based Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) for high-capacity and low-latency matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), which is a critical operation in artificial neural networks (ANNs). By leveraging photonic integrated circuits (PICs), which offer substantial bandwidth and low power consumption, we aim to accelerate ANN computations. We introduce a novel 3x3 beam splitter element capable of handling three-wave interference, demonstrating a potential reduction in optical depth for MVM operations compared to traditional methods based on two 2x2 couplings.
